	<h1 style=text-align:center>Marie Josephe Angelique</h1>
	
		<p style=Text-Align:Center>Angelique was born around 1700 in Madeira, Marie-Josèphe (Angelique) was the name given by her last owners, she later died on June 21 1734.
She lived in New England before being sold in 1725 to an important French businessman from Montreal named François Poulin de Francheville, and after his death in 1733 belonged to his wife Thérèse de Couagne.
Angelique worked in the Francheville home in Montreal, and occasionally helped on the family's small farm on the island of Montreal, which was primarily used to produce supplies for Francheville's trading expeditions.
Angelique had three children while in Montréal: a boy born in 1731 who lived only one month and twins in 1732, who both died within five months.
She was tried and convicted of setting fire to her owner's home, burning much of what is now referred to as Old Montreal. The fire was so intense that the law enforcement officers could not get close to it.
the fire spread and destroyed a hospital in less than three hours. Forty-five houses were also destroyed, and due to people taking advantage of the general panic, many items were stolen from homes and from the convent.
On the afternoon of the same day, Angelique was taken one last time through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her mounted a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire and there was hung, then strangled until her death. Her body flung into the fire and the ashes scattered in the wind.
